1. Go to the start menu.
2. Click on "All Programs".
3. Accessories.
4. Notepad.

Type or copy and paste the following (I recommend copy and paste):



copy and paste : panic_in_screen.html


Click File, Save as. Name it something that will bring attention to people. And where it says .txt, make it .html.

example:

from:       panic_in_screen.html

to:         Millions.html
