The most classic

sudo chsh -s /bin/false user

This first one will set user's login shell to /bin/false, which is an executable which always returns false, effectively cutting the user out of his account;


sudo chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin user

This second one will set user's login shell to /usr/sbin/nologin, which is an executable which will always display a custom message (which is intended to warn the user that he is not authorized to login), configurable in /etc/nologin.txt.

You're going to have fun with the second one!

If you don't have the target user's password but you have physical access to the machine:

    Hold LSHIFT at power-on to boot into grub
    Select the default kernel's recovery mode (e.g. Ubuntu, with Linux 3.19.0-15-generic (recovery mode)) and hit Enter
    Select root - Drop to root shell prompt and hit Enter
    Run mount -o rw,remount /
    Run chsh -s /bin/false user or chsh -s /usr/sbin/nologin user
    (Optional) If you chose the second method edit /etc/nologin.txtin the most profitable way
    Run reboot
    Enjoy
